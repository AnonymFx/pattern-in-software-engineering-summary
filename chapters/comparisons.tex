\section{Comparisons}

\subsection{Adapter vs. Bridge}
Both hide the detail of the underlying implementation, but:
\begin{itemize}
   \item the adapter (inheritance followed by delegation) is designed to handle incompatibilities
   \item the bridge (delegation followed by inheritance) is intended to differentiate between abstraction and implementation up-front
 \end{itemize}

 \subsection{Bridge vs. Strategy}
 The bridge is used for structural decisions on system startup whereas the strategy handles behavioral decisions on runtime based on changing criteria.

\subsection{Strategy vs. State}
The strategy pattern handles different algorithms at runtime whereas the state pattern handles different states of an object in the architecture.
